This project was developed to adjust .srt files not synchronized with the movie, creating a new file with the time of subtitle adjusted. 

With this script it will be possible to subtract or add time (in seconds) to adjust the synchronization.

Example:
Adding 23 seconds in first example and subtracting 10 seconds in the second example.

| Pattern of subtitle time |
start subtitle => end subtitle
(hh:mm:ss,fff) => (hh:mm:ss,fff)

Example 01: Original file (+23) 
00:01:20,078 => 00:01:23,427 #first line of subtitle

With the adjust of the script
00:01:43,078 => 00:01:46,427 #first line adjusted in the new file

Example 02: Original file (-10)
00:01:20,078 => 00:01:23,427 #first line of subtitle

With the adjust of the script
00:01:10,078 => 00:01:13,427 #first line adjusted in the new file
